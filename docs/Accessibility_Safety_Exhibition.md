# Accessibility, Safety & Exhibition Guidelines
***

## Accessibility Framework

### Core Principles
The Scattered Gazes installation is designed to be accessible to visitors with diverse abilities, following the **Social Model of Disability** - removing barriers rather than requiring visitors to adapt to inaccessible design.

### Physical Accessibility

**Installation Height & Positioning**
- Touch interface positioned at **1.1m height** (accessible to wheelchair users)
- Viewing window centre at **1.35m** for optimal accessibility
- **1.5m minimum clearance** around installation for wheelchair/mobility aid access
- No protruding elements below 2.1m that could pose head strike hazards

**Tactile & Visual Access**
- High-contrast LCD display with **18pt minimum font size**
- **Audio descriptions** available via QR code for all visual elements
- Tactile strips will be provided on the gallery floor only where necessary to mark changes in level or potential hazards, in line with BS 8300 guidance. For flat, unobstructed installation areas, physical accessibility will be ensured by clear floor space, accessible routes, and high-contrast signage. Visitors with visual impairments will be offered large-print guides, staff support, and QR-code audio descriptions as appropriate.
- **Antimicrobial coating** on touch surfaces for hygiene

### Sensory Considerations

**Audio Accessibility**
- **Maximum 75dB** audio output to prevent hearing damage
- Automatic volume adaptation based on ambient noise
- **Subtitles/transcripts** available via QR code link
- Clear, plain English narration without technical jargon

**Visual & Neurological Sensitivity**
- **No strobing or flashing lights** (seizure prevention)
- Gentle LED transitions (maximum 2 changes per second)
- **Quiet mode available** with reduced audio/lighting intensity
- Predictable interaction patterns to reduce anxiety

### Cognitive Accessibility

**Clear Navigation & Instructions**
- **Simple, descriptive button labels** on touch interface
- **Visual countdown timers** for decision-making periods
- **Multiple engagement levels**: street viewing, basic interaction, extended learning
- **Plain English signage** with pictorial elements where helpful

**Educational Accessibility**
- **Multiple learning formats**: audio, visual, tactile, written
- QR codes linking to **easy-read versions** of complex content
- **Large print materials** (18pt font) available on request
- Content designed for **multiple reading levels**
