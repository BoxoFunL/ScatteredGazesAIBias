# Technical Architecture
## Overview

This document details the technical architecture for the Scattered Gazes Arduino-controlled interactive installation. It covers all major system components, automation flow, hardware specifications, wiring, firmware design, safety protocols, and integration points needed for reliable operation and future development.

## System Components

**Main Controller:** Arduino Uno Rev3 (or Mega for extended IO)

**Scene Automation:** Dual SG90 or MG996R servo motors for backdrop transitions?

**Lighting:** WS2812B addressable LED strips (60 LEDs, 3 zones)

**User Interface:** resistive touch LCD display

**Audio System:** DFPlayer Mini MP3 module with 3W speaker output

**Sensors**: HC-SR04 proximity, DHT22 temperature/humidity, GL5537 photoresistor, KY-038 microphone(?)

**Power:** 5V 3A switching supply, backup battery, relay-based emergency cutoff
