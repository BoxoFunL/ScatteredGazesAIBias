# Post-Exhibition Legacy & Archive

## Overview

This document outlines procedures for  concluding the Scattered Gazes exhibition, preserving project outcomes, and ensuring ongoing accessibility of technical, artistic, and educational resources for future collaboration and research.

## Exhibition Wrap-Up Procedures

## Final Performance Documentation

**System Performance Data**
- Export complete usage analytics from Arduino logging system
- Document total visitor interactions and path selection statistics (Path A vs Path B choices)
- Record peak usage times, technical incidents, and system reliability metrics
- Archive environmental data (temperature, humidity, ambient light conditions)

**Visual Documentation**
- High-resolution photography of installation in final configuration
- Time-lapse video of typical visitor interaction sequences(?)
- Document any wear patterns or modifications made during exhibition
- Record final component condition for future installations

## Component Inventory & Condition Assessment
**Hardware Documentation**

Component Status Report:
- Arduino system: [Operational/Needs service/Replace]
- Servo motors: [Performance/Wear assessment]
- LED systems: [Dead pixel count/Colour accuracy]
- Touch interface: [Responsiveness/Screen condition]
- Audio system: [Quality/Component status]


**Packaging & Storage**
- Use antistatic materials for electronic components
- Document any custom modifications or calibrations
- Create component location map for future reassembly
- Store backup firmware and all custom code safely

## Digital Archive Creation

## Technical Documentation Archive

**Code Repository (GitHub)**
- Upload all Arduino sketches with clear version history
- Include circuit diagrams, wiring schematics, and PCB files
