# Critical Framework

## Project Ethos

Scattered Gazes is guided by a commitment to **decolonial research**, ethical AI art practice, and collaborative making across disciplinary boundaries.  
Our framework brings together feminist, postcolonial, and technical perspectives, with continuous consultation from represented communities.

## Key Theoretical Influences

- **Karen Barad** (agential realism):  
  Understanding matter and meaning as entangled; technology and representation actively shape the world.
- **Fatima Mernissi** (Moroccan feminism):  
  Emphasising non-Western agency, resistance to orientalism, and centring lived experience.
- **Islamic Artistic Traditions**:  
  Honouring religious and cultural practices (e.g. non-figurative representation; collective memory).

## Methodology

- **Critical Making:**  
  Theory is woven into the technical and artistic process. We build, test, and reflect with materials, code, and community voices - making biases visible and contestable.
- **Community Consultation:**  
  Representation decisions are made with ongoing input from Moroccan family members and cultural organisations.  
  Feedback loops guide both the aesthetic and technical features.
- **Open Source, Peer Review:**  
  All code, diagrams, and documentation are released openly, with reviews from team members and external collaborators.

## Collaborative Values

- Shared authorship, transparent process, and accountable innovation.
- Ethical boundaries: AI is used only for critique/education, never for reproducing or appropriating authentic cultural content.
- Accessibility and inclusion; documentation and technologies are designed for diverse publics (not just technical audiences).
