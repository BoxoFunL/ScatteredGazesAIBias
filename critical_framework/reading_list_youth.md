# Youth Reading List: Building Critical Digital Literacy
*Age-Scaffolded Works for Young Readers (Ages 8-18)*

## Why This List Exists
Young people are growing up in an AI-saturated world but often lack frameworks 
for critically analysing technology's cultural impacts. This list builds 
foundation skills through engaging stories and accessible non-fiction.

## Age-Based Navigation
Each section builds skills progressively:
- **Ages 8-12:** Identity, belonging, basic digital literacy
- **Ages 13-15:** Media criticism, historical context, bias recognition  
- **Ages 16-18:** Systemic analysis, activism, ethical technology development
