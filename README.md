Automated theatre project exploring colonial and gender bias in AI systems, combining Arduino-driven storytelling and feminist materialist theory. Open-source platform for collaborative critical making, decolonial technology research, and community centred artistic development.


**Project Overview**

ScatteredGazesAIBias is an open-source automated theatre project exploring how colonial and gender biases are encoded and perpetuated in AI systems. Built with Arduino-driven storytelling, it uses mechanical automation as a provocative medium for making algorithmic injustices visible and engaging audiences in critical reflection. The project was initiated in response to the need for fairer, community-driven, and decolonial approaches to technology, particularly artificial intelligence, and is being developed as a case study and collaborative prototype.


**Critical Framework**

This work draws on feminist materialist theory, particularly the concept of agential realism, which reveals how material and discursive practices co-produce meanings and realities, not only in physics but also in technological systems like AI. Inspired by Fatima Mernissi's work, the project centres on how patriarchal and colonial power structures become embedded in technology, especially in algorithms that misrepresent or erase marginalised voices.


Rather than attempting to 'fix' AI bias with technical interventions alone, ScatteredGazesAIBias uses automation and performance to ask: 
- Who defines technological norms?
- Who defines ethics?
- Whose bodies and voices are erased in the systems we build
- How can creative, critical making expose and challenge these harms?

The project prioritises intersectional perspectives and participatory approaches. We invite collaboration to create alternative technological futures that resist hierarchical binaries and build solidarity across communities impacted by bias.
